This repo is a start on an open-source computer use agent with a Llama 3.2 11B Vision Finetune. It works by finetuning on a large dataset of web UI images and 

Steps to run:
1) Clone repo onto your cluster
2) Clone repo on your local machine
3) From local machine launch the jupyter client script to get a jupyter notebook on the SFSU Cluster
4) Alternatively, remote into the CPU node with ssh and simply run "sbatch finetune_lora_slurm.sh" to run the training script on the GPU cluster

In training/logs, you can see the result of accuracy_benchmark.py for each epoch, which measures the error in the bounding box generated by the model.
