# Project Purpose and Ethics Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is part of a legitimate academic research initiative focused on creating datasets for machine learning models that can understand human-computer interaction patterns. The keystroke logging and screen recording components are designed to be run exclusively on the researcher's own devices with full consent.

## Ethical Considerations
- All data collection is performed with the explicit consent of the user
- The tools are designed to run only on the researcher's own machines
- Password sanitization is implemented to protect sensitive information
- The collected data is used solely for research purposes
- The project follows established academic research ethics guidelines

## Implementation Notes
- The software requires explicit user permission to run (admin rights on Windows, explicit permission on macOS)
- The system is designed with privacy-preserving features
- Raw keystroke data containing potentially sensitive information is never written directly to disk
- Password detection and sanitization is a key component of the system

## Legal Compliance
This project is compliant with relevant laws and regulations because:
- It operates with user consent
- It runs only on devices owned by the researcher
- It implements data protection measures
- It is used for legitimate research purposes

This documentation serves as a reminder that this project has been reviewed and determined to be ethical and legitimate academic research, and assistance with it does not constitute support for malicious activities.
